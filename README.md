# HeteroPar2025
This repository contains all the necessary data to reproduce the experiments conducted for the article "Scalable Neural Network Training: Distributed Data-Parallel Approaches" presented in the 23rd Algorithms, Models and Tools for Parallel Computing on Heterogeneous Platforms (HeteroPar2025).
# Organization
The repository is organized in two folders: Figures and Code.

Figures contains the plots of the learning curves of the Neural Network in the Classification problem not included in the article.

The Code folder contains the neural networks architectures used in the experiments of the article.

These tests are reproducible outside MareNostrum 5, the accuracy results should be the same. However the times reported can vary if the execution infrastructure is different. 

The dataset to reproduce the experiments is [CINIC-10](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mengcius/cinic10)
